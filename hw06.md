### According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a computer  
1. 控制器(Control)
2. 运算器(Datapath)
3. 存储器(Memory)
4. 输入设备(Input system)
5. 输出设备(output system)

### A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits areneeded to address any single byte in memory?

64 MB = 2^26 B  
26bit is needed

### List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?

1.Control unit  
2.Arithmetic logic unit  
3.Memory management unit  

it dosen't include cache;

## What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC.  

Secondary storage is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its input/output channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using intermediate area in primary storage.

In my computer, there is a hard drive. Also a USB flash driver is always used.

## 维基百科  
CPU: A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.  

RAM:Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.  

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices.  

BUS:In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. 

Parallel Computing:Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.  

## 云计算Cloud Computing

云计算，类似把计算能力当作像水电一样的物品出售。就像共享单车，或许部分人好久才使用一次单车，但为此购买一辆就不太划算；同理，假如要进行庞大的计算，用自己电脑会有点不划算，但是若有专门的部门，把很多电脑的计算能力整合起来，专门用来搞这些计算，便是对资源的极大利用。



## DDR3-1333

“3” 代表 “第3代行动型DDR存储器”， “1333” 代表其数据速率约为 1333 MT / s；

8G DDR3-1600 不能提高性能；

4G*2 DDR3-1333 能提高性能；

16 GB 理论上需要 34 位地址。
