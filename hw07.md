## Machine code & assembly code

int_8 a = 1; int_8 c = a + 3;

1.

The following variable W and X in assembly code represent variable a and c respectively in original C language code.

Assembly	Machine
LOD #1	0001 0100 0000 0001
STO W	0000 0101 1000 0000
LOD W	0000 0100 1000 0000
ADD #3	0001 0000 0000 0011
STO X	0000 0101 1000 0001

When a cycle starts, the control unit first goes to the memory specified in the PC, makes a copy of the contents, and places the copy in the IR. This is called ‘Fetch’.

Then, the circuits in the hardware will decide which instruction to perform. This is called ‘Decode’.

After that, the hardware will perform what it should do according to the instruction. This is called ‘Execute’.

3.

IR contains the instruction currently being executed.

PC contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.

ACC is a register which stores intermediate arithmetic and logic results.

4.

‘a & c’ means that to get the result of the data in location ‘a’ AND the data in location ‘c’ bitwise.



Questions and answers  

1.

Anything that can be represented as some bits can be stored in memory.

2.

A data and an instruction can be stored in the same place.

3.

In a PIPPIN machine, an instruction contains 2 bytes, namely 16 bits.

The higher 4 bits of the first byte stand for addressing mode. 0000 indicates direct mode and 0001 indicates immediate mode.

The lower 4 bits of the first byte stand for opcode.

The second byte stands for operand.

For example, the opcode of an ADD operation is 0000, so the instruction for ‘add 3 to ACC’ is ‘0001 0000 0000 0011’. The first 4 bits are 0001 since the addressing mode here is immediate mode.

Another example, the opcode of a STO (store) operation is 0101, so the instruction for ‘store the current value of ACC to location 1000 0000’ is ‘0000 0101 1000 0000’.

#### Assembly language

Assembly language is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program’s statements and the architecture’s machine code instructions.

汇编语言是任何一种具有以下特性编程语言：它的语句与机器码指令有很强的对应关系。

#### Compiler

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

编译器是一种软件，它把高级编程语言翻译成机器码以创建一个可执行程序。编译器也可以用来把一种语言的代码转为另一种。技术上说，编译器是一种支持数字设备（主要是计算机）的翻译程序。

#### Imperative programming

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

在计算机科学领域，命令式编程是一种使用改变程序状态的语句的编程范式，它很大程度上与自然语言的祈使句相同，命令式程序包含让计算机执行的命令。命令式编程着重描述一个程序是如何运行的。

#### Functional programming

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

在计算机科学领域，函数式编程是一种编程范式，它把计算当作数学函数的赋值，并避免了可改变的状态和可改变的数据。它是一种声明性的编程范式，这意味着是用表达式和声明来编程，而不是语句。

#### Procedural programming

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

过程式编程是一种编程范式，它从结构化编程衍生出来，其基础是过程的调用。
