### Differences between class and object
A class is used to describe a type of things with the similar features. An object is an instance of a class. We can simply take ‘class’ to be abstract, and ‘object’ to be concrete. For example, in the game, the class ‘Priest’ describes a type of men who may be killed at some time. This class has 3 objects, the 3 priests respectively. They have something in common. That is, all of the three may be killed at some time. But they are still not the same, because their current state can be different.

#### Attributes and methods of devils
```
class Devil {
    int current_state;
    int current_side;

    void GetOnBoat();
    void GetOffBoat();
    void KillPriest();
};
```
#### onclick
```
void onclick(Devil devil) {
    if (devil is on bank) {
        if (!(boat is moving) && boat is on the same side of devil && !(boat is full)) {
            devil.GetOnBoat();
        }
    }
    else {
        if (!(boat is moving)) {
            devil.GetOffBoat();
        }
    }
}
```
### Can class and object be verbs?
Usually not. Since a class describes a type of things and an object describes a certain thing, they are always nouns. Verbs are usually used to name the methods of class, because the methods are used to describe ‘do something’.
